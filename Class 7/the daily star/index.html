		<h1>A child's wait for her mother who didn't return</h1>
		<p>
			Palash Khan

			Eyes dazed and a face blank, five-year-old Sanin was on the arms of her father standing just yards off the morgue at Dhaka Medical College.

			Her father was careful to not let her close to the stink of the charred remains that lay inside, but not far enough for the hint of stench that kept the air heavy around it.

			Her mother Shila, 25, has been missing since Wednesday night and they were waiting to confirm if her body remained among the unidentified corpses.

			“She (Shila) went out to bring some medicine for Sanin moments before the fire,” said the father Suman, a workshop employee of Chawkbazar who lived nearby.

			“She never returned,” said Sumon who was breaking down in tears. <br />

			Sumon lives just around 200 yards from the spot from where the fire erupted. He managed to survive the blaze with Sannin and a five-month-old daughter, but fears that his wife Shila might have been perished in the inferno.

			None of those inside Haider Pharmacy, where Shila went to buy the medicines, survived, he claimed. “I think my wife has also died,” he said.

			Since this morning, Sumon has been carrying around Sanin in his arms and running up and down through Dhaka Medical College morgue and the information desk.

			Now, a confirmation can only be obtained after Criminal Investigation Department (CID) runs a DNA matching of those corpses which have been burned beyond recognition.

		<h1>Govt can't shrug off responsibility.</h1>
		Says Obaidul Quader about old town tragedy .
		<p>
		
			Staff Correspondent

			Road, Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader yesterday said the government could not shrug off responsibility for the Chawkbazar tragedy.

			“If anything happens in the country, the government can't avoid the responsibility as it's in power… this is a fact,” he said said while replying to a reporter's question outside the Dhaka Medical College Hospital burn unit.

			On Wednesday night, a devastating fire ripped through several building in old Dhaka's Chawkbazar area. At least 67 people were killed in the incident.

			The incident brings to mind the Nimtoli fire that killed 124 in 2010. It had sparked a public outcry, demanding relocation of chemical warehouses and stores from the area, but little has been done in the last nine years.

			The minister claimed that the authorities had taken measures to remove chemical warehouses from the old town after the Nimtoli disaster.

			Quader, also the ruling Awami League's general secretary, went to the burn unit to visit the injured victims. He also provided financial assistance to nine on behalf of his party.

			Talking to the report, he said there was no alternative to “start afresh taking lessons from mistakes”.

			He also said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already instructed all the authorities concerned, including the Dhaka South City Corporation, to shift all chemical warehouses from old Dhaka as early as possible.

			“The government is not sitting idle. It is working so that similar incidents don't reoccur. But those involved in the business also remain conscious about the danger they are handling. Life is under severe risk here….” He said.

			Quader also said the government would not let any of those responsible for the Chawkbazar tragedy to get off scot free.  

			He said the government had already instructed to find alternatives to gas cylinders as incidents of explosion of such cylinders in vehicles have increased.

			The senior AL leader then called upon the BNP not to do politics over the Chawkbazar incident.

			Talking to reporters at a programme, Information Minister Hasan Mahmud said that government was tried hard to face the Chawkbazar crisis.
